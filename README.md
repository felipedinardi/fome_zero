# Fome Zero Project – Data Analysis for a Restaurant Marketplace

## 1. Business Problem
Fome Zero is a restaurant marketplace whose main objective is to connect customers with restaurants, facilitating the discovery, evaluation, and negotiation of food services. The platform aggregates information such as location, cuisine type, table reservation availability, online delivery, average price, and customer ratings.

With the recent hiring of a new CEO, the company identified the need to better understand the business through data in order to support strategic decisions related to expansion, market positioning, service quality, and user engagement.

In this context, the goal of this project is to perform a business-oriented exploratory data analysis and develop interactive dashboards that answer the company’s key strategic questions. The analyses are structured across different levels: overall, country, city, restaurant, and cuisine type.

## 2. Business Assumptions
The following assumptions were considered throughout the project:

- Fome Zero operates under a marketplace business model, connecting supply (restaurants) and demand (customers).
- Customer ratings reasonably reflect users’ perceptions of restaurant quality.
- The average cost for two people is used as a proxy for the average ticket size.
- Each restaurant is treated as an independent unit of analysis.
- The analyses are organized into multiple views (overall, country, city, and cuisine) to facilitate executive-level interpretation.

## 3. Solution Strategy
The solution strategy followed these main steps:

- Data cleaning and standardization to ensure metric consistency.
- Creation of new features and derived metrics as required for the analyses.
- Business-driven exploratory data analysis.
- Development of interactive dashboards using Streamlit, organized into the following views:
  - Overall View  
  - Country View  
  - City View  
  - Cuisine Type View  

The focus was on transforming raw data into actionable insights to support executive decision-making.

## 4. Top 3 Data Insights
- India and the United States account for the largest number of registered restaurants, indicating priority markets in terms of volume and scalability potential.
- Indonesia, despite having fewer restaurants, shows the highest average ratings, suggesting a potential benchmark for service quality and customer experience.
- Several Brazilian cities have restaurants with average ratings below 2.5, signaling possible issues related to quality, platform curation, or market fit.

## 5. Final Project Deliverable
The main deliverable of this project is an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit, allowing users to explore the data dynamically and intuitively, including:

- Restaurant volume and ratings by country and city.
- Rankings of the best and worst cuisine types.
- Analysis of the impact of online delivery and table reservations on customer engagement.
- Interactive maps showing restaurant locations.

## 6. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis can generate relevant strategic insights for a restaurant marketplace. Factors such as cuisine type, service offerings (online delivery and reservations), and geographic location show a strong relationship with customer engagement and ratings.

The proposed solution provides the CEO with a clear and structured view of the business, supporting more informed, data-driven decision-making.

## 7. Next Steps
As next steps, it is recommended to:

- Refine and prioritize the most relevant metrics for executive leadership.
- Reduce the number of indicators, focusing on those with the greatest strategic impact.
- Create new, targeted views to support strategic decisions such as geographic expansion or platform quality improvement.
- Evolve the project with more advanced analyses, such as restaurant segmentation or correlation studies between price, services, and ratings.

Future projects may explore statistical and predictive modeling using datasets more suitable for advanced analytical techniques.# fome_zero
